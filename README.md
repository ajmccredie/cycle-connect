## Initial proposed database structure to meet the problem statement

Explanation of the different parts and how they interlink.

## Division of the Django project into specific 'Apps'
From the database structure, the apps were decided and worked on individually. The initial minimum viable product set up was to ensure that users could sign-up with a mini-profile and then be able to write, update and delete posts on the user forum, and read and like the posts of others.

## Agile project planning and methodology
Initial collection of user stories were made, categorised for 'must', 'should' and 'could' and then used in conjunction with GitHub Projects.
Meeting the user stories was then planned with a series of goals, and then split down further into sprints. The proposed sprints were then met fully or partially, and any incomplete work was reassessed as to its value and where it should be placed.
